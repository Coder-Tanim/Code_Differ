# Code_Differ
A lightweight Chrome extension for developers and QA engineers to quickly compare two code snippets (old vs. new) and highlight only the new or changed lines in the updated code. Unchanged lines remain unhighlighted for a clean, focused view. Perfect for code reviews, bug fixes, or spotting diffs during agile sprints.
